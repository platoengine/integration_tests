This test is an SO problem that minimizes compliance with a volume constraint. It is meant to test using multiple ESP performers in an optimization. The file rocker.csm is set to initialize the problem with values that were achieved after 100 optimization iterations. The problem was not converged yet, but should be close enough that any further progress only changes the values by a small amount. Thus the test runs an optimization for another two iterations and compares the result to the original values to check if they are within a set tolerance.
